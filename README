| Logserver Patch for IoURT 4.1 |
+-------------------------------+


This repository contains the IoUrbanTerror gameserver code, the scope of the project is to patch the code in such a manner that the logging is done via UDP rather than written to file.

This enables gameserver farms to have a single separate server for logging and game stats, and gamebot developers to avoid opening and parsing logfiles or installing the gamebot on the same machine used by the gameserver.

Kudos to Rambetter who set up a svn repository having many useful patches. The original code of this project was taken from his svn repo. You can find it here: http://forums.urbanterror.info/topic/18495-svn-repository-for-iourbanterror-exploit-fixes/

USAGE:
1) download and build the code: the executable will be created inside the build/ folder.
2) backup your ~/.q3a/q3ut4 folder.
3) create default.cfg (touch ~/.q3a/q3ut4/default.cfg) otherwise the gameserver won't start.
4) create autoexec.cfg and put in it:

	seta logserver_enable "1"
	seta logserver_address "localhost:27961"
	seta logserver_user "yourname"
	seta logserver_password "yourpass"

5) use netcat to listen for incoming udp packets on the selected port (27961):

	nc -ul 27961

6) start the server. Yopu should receive in netcat the string

	"\uyourname\pyourpass"

   repeated 10 times.

-how to add cvars;
-how to keep static data in the gameserver memory;
-how to send a message via UDP.
