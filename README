| Logserver Patch for IoURT 4.1 |
+-------------------------------+


This repository contains the IoUrbanTerror gameserver code, the scope of the project is to patch the code in such a manner that the logging is done via UDP rather than written to file.

This enables gameserver farms to have a single separate server for logging and game stats, and gamebot developers to avoid opening and parsing logfiles or installing the gamebot on the same machine used by the gameserver.

Kudos to Rambetter who set up a svn repository having many useful patches. The original code of this project was taken from his svn repo. You can find it here: http://forums.urbanterror.info/topic/18495-svn-repository-for-iourbanterror-exploit-fixes/

If you want some directions on how the ioquake3 server works, read this: http://nrfw.org/q3_coding_tips.html
It explains briefly:
-the big picture;
-how to add cvars;
-how to keep static data in the gameserver memory;
-how to send a message via UDP.
