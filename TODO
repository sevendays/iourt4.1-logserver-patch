FOR ANY RELEASE, WE NEED, ON EACH PLATFORM:

1) Testing of Quake 3 single player, and network games (pb will never work)
2) Testing of Quake 3: Team Arena, SP and MP, etc
3) Testing of at least one other Quake 3 mod, rq3.com, urbanterror.net,
   whatever
4) Installers which include all up-to-date id pak files, require no cd rom,
   user will have to copy pak0.pk3 themselves.
4a) installers that require no cd-rom can optionally install the data from cd
-roms, just that people can deal with pak0s themselves and not be forced into
locating the disc right then -at install time.
